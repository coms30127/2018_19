The nonlinear dynamics that neurons rely on to form spikes arise from
the \textbf{voltage-gated channels}; these are ion channels whose
conductance varies as the voltage varies. They are tiny molecular
machines which, crucially, are ion selective: only sodium ions can
pass through a sodium gate, only potassium ions through a potassium
gate. Each individual gate has a number of different gating states, we
will briefly examine this, but ultimately each one is either open or
closed, the overall smooth, though rapid, variation in these
conductances comes from average a large number of individual discrete
step-like changes as the individual gates open and close.

The potassium channel is a \textbf{persistent} gate; this is actually
a little complicated, but roughly speaking it has one type of closed
state and one type of open state; the sodium channel, which we will
look at after the potassium channel also has one open state, but it
has two types of closed states.

\end{figure}

To the approximation we are working with here, and the one assumed by Hodgkin and Huxley, potassium gate is actually composed of four independent subgates\footnote{In fact the gates aren't completely independent, so a more complicated model would model the potassium channel as having found closed states with different transition probabilities between them:
  $$\mbox{closed 4}\rightarrow\mbox{closed 3}\rightarrow\mbox{closed
    2}\rightarrow\mbox{closed 1}\rightarrow\mbox{open}$$ }, all these
gates must be open to allow potassium ions through, but each has its
own independent dynamics. The membrane is usually modelled as having
overall potassium conductance
\begin{equation}
g_{K}=\bar{g}_Kn^4
\end{equation}
where $\bar{g}_K$ would be conductance if all the channels were open
and $n$ is the probability an individual subgate is open so $n^4$ is
the probability an individual gated channel is open.

The dynamical equation for $n$ is quite complicated: it has a Markovian forms
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dn}{dt}=\alpha_n(1-n)-\beta_nn
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_n$ is the opening rate of closed subgates and $\beta_n$
the closing rate of open subgates. It is useful to think of $n$ as the
proportion of subgates that are open, this is almost the same as
thinking of $n$ as the probability of an individual gate being
open. Now $(1-n)$ is the proportion of subgates that are closed and
hence $\alpha_n(1-n)$ is the rate at which subgates are opening. Now,
it is easier to interpret the dynamics of these equations if we
rewrite them in a form that's more familiar to us, by moving the terms
around it can be written in the standard form
\begin{equation}
\tau_n(V)\frac{dn(t)}{dt}=n_\infty(V)-n(t)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \tau_n=\frac{1}{\alpha_n+\beta_n}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  n_\infty=\frac{\alpha_n}{\alpha_n+\beta_n}
\end{equation}
If $\tau_n(V)$ and $n_\infty(V)$ where constant this would be simple,
$n(t)$ would decay to $n_\infty$ with a timescale of $\tau_n$, however
they aren't constants, they are functions of the membrane potential. 

A graph of $n_\infty(V)$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:asymp_vals}. We can
see that $n$ is small when the voltage is near the resting value but
climbs towards one as $V$ increases. Now, $n$ isn't equal to
$n_\infty$, rather it decays towards it with a time constant given by
$\tau_n(V)$, but we can see that the potassium channels open as the
voltage increases. Before looking at how these play a role in spiking
we will look at the sodium gates. It is worth noting though the way
having four independent gates makes the dynamics crisper: if $n$ is
near zero, $n^4$ is very small indeed. This is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:nfour}.

We also need to discuss reversal potentials. You would expect the flow
of potassium to be determined by $g_KV$, but it isn't; because there
are more potassium ions inside the cell than outside they would flow
out even if $V=0$. In fact, as we discussed when looking at the
integrate and flow model, we assume this doesn't change Ohm's law, the
relationship between potential difference and current, rather, it just
changes the zero point:
\begin{equation}
I_{\mbox{\scriptsize{K}}}=g_{\mbox{\scriptsize{K}}}(E_{\mbox{\scriptsize{K}}}-V)
\end{equation}
where $E_K=-70$ mV, approximately, is called the reversal potential
and can be calculated using an equation called the Nernst equation.

\caption{A cartoon of the two types of voltage gated channel we are
  discussing; the persistent potassium channels open as the voltage
  rise, the transient sodium channel opens and then closes
  again.\label{ChannelsBlack}}
\end{figure}



The sodium channel is called a transient channel because it has two
closed states and one open one; generally its dynamics during the
spike is
\begin{equation}
\mbox{closed I}\rightarrow \mbox{open}\rightarrow\mbox{closed II}
\end{equation}
After that there is a slower process of resetting. The part of the
gate that is closed to give the initial closed state is very like the
potassium gate, but with three subgates; the probability of these
subgates being open is usually called $m$; the other part, the gate
that closes to give the second closed state is different in that it is
not made of subgates, its probability of being open is usually called
$h$ and its asymptotic value, $h_\infty$, is near one for lower $V$
and near zero for larger. A cartoon of all this is given in Fig.~\ref{ChannelsBlack}. Fig.~\ref{fig:asymp_vals} includes graphs of $m_\infty(V)$
and $h_\infty(V)$. Finally, the reversal potential for sodium is
$E_{Na}=50$ mV. The sodium current is therefore
\begin{equation}
I_{\mbox{\scriptsize{Na}}}=g_{\mbox{\scriptsize{Na}}}(E_{\mbox{\scriptsize{Na}}}-V)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
g_{\mbox{\scriptsize{Na}}}=\bar{g}_{\mbox{\scriptsize{Na}}}m^3h
\end{equation}


All of this together gives the Hodgkin-Huxley equation, basically it
equates the rate of change of $V$ to a set of currents, the leak
current giving the roughly linear behavior below threshold we saw in
the integrate and fire model and the gated channels forming the
spike.
\begin{equation}
C_m\frac{dV}{dt}=\mbox{currents}
\end{equation}
In this case this is
\begin{equation}
C_m\frac{dV}{dt}=g_l(E_l-V)+\bar{g}_{\mbox{\scriptsize{Na}}}m^3h(E_{\mbox{\scriptsize{Na}}}-V)+\bar{g}_{\mbox{\scriptsize{K}}}n^4(E_{\mbox{\scriptsize{K}}}-V)+I_e
\end{equation}
where the first term is the leak current, the second the sodium current, the third potassium and the fourth an input current.


We can now give a rough description of how spikes are formed. The time
constants $\tau$ for the three gating probabilities are given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tau_vals}, these are quite complicated, but the key
thing is that $\tau_m$ is very small, no matter what the value of $V$
is. This means that $m$ stays very close to its asymptotic value
$m_\infty$. As $V$ approaches the threshold of about $-55$ mV, $m$
increases towards one, with $m^3$ increasing even more
dramatically. Opening the sodium gates allows sodium to flood the
cell, increasing the $V$ further and further opening the gates. This
gives the rapid upswing in voltage, the rising part of the spike. The
other two gating probabilities have slower dynamics and it takes $n$
and $h$ a while to catch up with $n_\infty$ and $h_\infty$. However,
as $h$ decreases, it closes the sodium gates again, preventing more
sodium getting in to the cell; $n$ increases opens the potassium
gates, potassium flows out reducing the $V$ again, back towards -70
mV. This gives the downswing of the spike. Afterwards everything
resets. An example spike is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HH_spike}.

\caption{Some spikes in the HH model. This shows the spikes produced by a standard HH model in response to a current input.\label{fig:HH_spike}}
\end{figure}

For a more accurate model further channels, and therefore further
currents, can be added, other sodium and potassium channels with
different dynamics, or a calcium channel. It is also common to
investigate models \lq{}between\rq{} the integrate and fire model and
the Hodgkin-Huxley equation which add some of the nonlinearity to the
integrate and fire dynamics. That is what we do next.
